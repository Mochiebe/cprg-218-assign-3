            <h2>Lapse App</h2>
            <p>Lapse is a Memory Snapshot app that develops your photos in about an hour or so as if it were taken on a polaroid! I love the vintage effect it gives some photos and the best part is it is a social media app itself so you can follow others and view their snapshots as well!</p>

            <h2>Self timer!</h2>
            <p>If you're wanting to take a group photo or set a shot up to get yourself in, I usually either prop my phone up and use the camera's timer. Another great trick I've learned is to set up your phone to take a video, and you can always screenshot photos from the video. They won't be as high of quality, but for example the picture of lighting in the hero banner of this page was a screenshot of a time-lapse, that I wouldn't have otherwise snapped in real-time with my slow reaction and regular camera!</p>

        <div class="panel">
            <h2>Camera app settings</h2>
            <p>Obviously when the average person is on the go, they don't exactly have a light kit ready to set up and take the perfect shot, or the best camera to take high quality photos and edit them later. With your smart phone alone, playing with the focus point or the light exposure settings can really emphasize some of the colours and lighting in your photos. Use these small settings to capture the perfect moment!</p>
